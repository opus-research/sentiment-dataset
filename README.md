# Replication package for "From Code to Emotion: A Robust Pull-Request Dataset for Advancing Sentiment Analysis in Software Engineering"

The file [dataset_promise.json](dataset_promise.json) contains an semi-anonymized version (no project names or links to the original messages, but messages may contain links or usernames) of the dataset described in the paper. 

Additional artifacts, such as the scripts utilized to build the dataset and documentation about the structure of the dataset, will be available after blind review, when they will be disponibilized in a permanent (and DOI compatible) file sharing solution such as Zenodo.
